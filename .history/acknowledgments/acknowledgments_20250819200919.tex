As a sign of gratitude, I wish to express my sincere thanks to all those who contributed, in one way or another, to the completion of this modest work.

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Professor \textbf{Sidi Mohammed BENSLIMANE}, for his expert guidance, unwavering patience, and constant encouragement throughout the development of this work. His insightful feedback and rigorous critique have been invaluable in shaping the direction and enhancing the quality of this thesis.

I am also profoundly thankful to the \textbf{École Supérieure en Informatique de Sidi Bel Abbès} for providing a stimulating academic environment, access to essential resources, and a community of faculty and peers whose support has been indispensable.

My sincere appreciation extends to all the dedicated teachers and professors who have guided me throughout my five years of study at this esteemed institution. Their knowledge, expertise, and commitment to education have been fundamental in building the foundation that made this work possible. Each lesson, each piece of advice, and each moment of encouragement has contributed to my academic and personal growth.

I would also like to thank my fellow students and colleagues who have shared this academic journey with me. Their collaboration, discussions, and friendship have enriched my learning experience and made these years memorable.

Finally, I owe boundless appreciation to my \textbf{family} for their unconditional love, moral support, and faith in my abilities. Their constant encouragement has been my greatest source of motivation throughout this academic journey. Without their sacrifices and unwavering belief in my potential, this achievement would not have been possible.
